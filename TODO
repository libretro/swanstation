List of things to be done, in no particular order:
- Implement Libretro VFS
- Implement D3D12 renderer
- Implement touchscreen support for Namco GunCon (currently only works with mouse)
- Get Libretro rewind to work without having to disable the recompiler
- Allow booting into the BIOS when either a non-PSX disc or no disc is inserted
- Implement a HLE BIOS
- On Windows, allow compiling the core without having to install Visual Studio
- Provide a static Makefile like all other Libretro cores
- Check for and remove all code not used for Libretro (settings, IO & etc.)
